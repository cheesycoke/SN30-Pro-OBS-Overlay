# SN30-Pro-OBS-Overlay
Input Overlay Config for 8BitDo SN30 Pro

This is made for univrsal's [Input Overlay](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay) OBS plugin meant to represent 8BitDo's SN30 Pro line, made using their [Config tool](https://univrsal.github.io/input-overlay/cct/)

Simply install Input Overlay 5.0+ to OBS, set the image to the one provided and the config file to the provided JSON, and it should all work! It has some minor alignment issues but I hope this should be good enough for anyone wanting a more minimalistic graphic to represent the controller.
